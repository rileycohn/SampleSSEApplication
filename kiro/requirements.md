# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a basic Server-Sent Events (SSE) proof of concept consisting of a simple server that publishes random number events and a frontend application that can connect to specific event streams. The system is designed for local development and testing purposes, focusing on simplicity over production features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple SSE server with a basic API endpoint, so that I can test server-sent event functionality locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL expose an endpoint at `/sse/{id}` that accepts GET requests
2. WHEN a client connects to `/sse/{id}` THEN the server SHALL establish an SSE connection for that specific ID
3. WHEN an SSE connection is established THEN the server SHALL continuously generate random numbers and publish them as events
4. WHEN publishing events THEN the server SHALL wait 10 seconds between each event
5. WHEN the server runs THEN it SHALL operate on localhost for local development

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple frontend interface, so that I can connect to different SSE streams and observe the events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads THEN it SHALL display a text input field for entering an ID
2. WHEN the frontend loads THEN it SHALL display a "Connect" button to initiate the SSE connection
3. WHEN a user enters an ID and clicks "Connect" THEN the frontend SHALL establish an SSE connection to `/sse/{id}`
4. WHEN events are received THEN the frontend SHALL display the random numbers in real-time
5. WHEN the frontend runs THEN it SHALL operate locally without external dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle basic connection scenarios, so that I can test different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple clients connect to the same ID THEN each client SHALL receive the same stream of events
2. WHEN a client disconnects THEN the server SHALL handle the disconnection gracefully
3. WHEN no clients are connected to an ID THEN the server SHALL continue generating events for active connections only
4. WHEN the server generates events THEN each event SHALL contain a random number and timestamp
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
